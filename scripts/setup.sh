## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Todo App with AI Assistant
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Author:** Joshua Park

## Executive Summary
A modern todo application that leverages AI to help users organize, prioritize, and complete their tasks more effectively.

## Problem Statement
- Users struggle with task prioritization and organization
- Existing todo apps lack intelligent assistance
- No automated task breakdown for complex projects

## Solution Overview
- AI-powered task prioritization and suggestions
- Intelligent task breakdown for complex projects
- Natural language task creation
- Smart scheduling and reminders

## Target Users
- Busy professionals managing multiple projects
- Students organizing coursework and assignments
- Anyone looking to improve productivity with AI assistance

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Task Management**
   - Description: Basic CRUD operations for tasks
   - User Story: As a user, I want to create, edit, and delete tasks so that I can manage my workload
   - Acceptance Criteria: 
     - [ ] Create tasks with title, description, due date
     - [ ] Edit existing tasks
     - [ ] Mark tasks as complete
     - [ ] Delete tasks
   - Priority: High
   - Estimated Effort: Medium

2. **AI Task Assistant**
   - Description: AI-powered task suggestions and prioritization
   - User Story: As a user, I want AI to help prioritize my tasks so that I focus on what's most important
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] AI analyzes task context and suggests priorities
     - [ ] Natural language task creation
     - [ ] Intelligent task breakdown for complex items
   - Priority: High
   - Estimated Effort: Large

3. **Smart Scheduling**
   - Description: Intelligent scheduling based on user patterns and deadlines
   - User Story: As a user, I want the app to suggest optimal times for task completion
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Analyze user productivity patterns
     - [ ] Suggest optimal scheduling
     - [ ] Send smart reminders
   - Priority: Medium
   - Estimated Effort: Large

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- AI response time < 3 seconds
- Support 1000+ concurrent users

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Setup project structure and development environment
- [ ] Configure database and basic authentication
- [ ] Create core data models
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Implement basic task CRUD operations
- [ ] Create user interface for task management
- [ ] Add user authentication and authorization
- [ ] Setup basic API endpoints

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] Integrate Claude API for task assistance
- [ ] Implement natural language task processing
- [ ] Add AI-powered prioritization
- [ ] Create intelligent task breakdown feature

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Deployment
- [ ] Add smart scheduling features
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production deployment and monitoring

## Success Metrics
- User task completion rate > 75%
- Daily active users > 1000 within 3 months
